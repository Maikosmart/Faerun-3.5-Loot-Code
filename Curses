# Common Curses for Magic Items

| d% Range | Curse Type | What It Really Means |
|---------:|------------|--------------------|
| 01–15 | **Delusion** | The item *pretends* to have powers… but they are entirely imaginary. The wielder believes, the DM laughs. |
| 16–35 | **Opposite Effect or Target** | Healing becomes harming, slaying arrows seek your friends, “buffs” become self-nerfs. Delicious betrayal. |
| 36–45 | **Intermittent Functioning** | The item occasionally decides it's *on break*. Random failure exactly when needed most. |
| 46–60 | **Requirement** | Item demands behaviors, items, or rituals. “Only works while wearing a dead goldfish on your hat.” |
| 61–75 | **Drawback** | Side-effects. Every use may hurt or inconvenience. Stuff like “You glow and scream for 1d6 rounds.” |
| 76–90 | **Completely Different Effect** | The label is a lie. Looks like Boots of Speed. Turns out: Boots of Interpretive Dance. |
| 91–100 | **Substitute Cursed Item** | Surprise! You never got the real loot—this was always a cursed copy. The merchant already left town. |
